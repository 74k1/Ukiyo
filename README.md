# Ukiyo Linux theme
An edited GTK Theme with my own Cursor. Neatly packaged for Nix usage.

# Files
* .config:
  * gtk-3.0: Sets some theme settings
* /usr/share/themes/Ukiyo: GTK theme. Edited Colors from another theme. If I got the time to do my own from scratch, I'll update this.
* /usr/share/icons/Ukiyo: Cursor theme. 100% Selfmade. (with the help of win2xcur) (If you know how to make xcursor files directly from scratch: https://taki.moe/contact)
